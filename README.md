# Contact Management System

This C++ program is a command-line contact management system using PF concepts as File handline that allows users to perform various operations like adding, listing, searching, editing, and deleting contacts. The program utilizes dynamic memory allocation and file handling to store and manage contact information.

## Usage:

2. Choose an option from the main menu.
3. Follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.
